I usually gravitate towards game that are filled with code aesthetically, however I really liked that the game included multiple levels, because it made me want to win and reach the higher goals each time. I kept restarting the game just so I could beat my previous score. The coding of it seems really hard and tought about, because the red flies are more rare than the black ones, instead of appearing each time they get out of frame. It also seemed like the speed of the flies kept increasing for each level, and the blue obstacles made it harder each time to win, because of the coding that made it impossible for the tongue to overlap it. The winning/losing messages are also quite humorous. I like that. Overall, the experience was good and it was easy to follow the rules, and understand the interactive part of it.

(https://matiamp.github.io/cart253/mod-jam/) The overall concept of the game is very fun, so is the audio. The sound effects whenever a hotdog is being eaten, or when a broccoli is being eaten is also funny. I find the use of arrays very impressive, because it is one of the subject in javascript that I have the most difficulty understanding and using in my codes. I think that being able to choose whether I want to use my mouse or the arrows keys to move the frog, and lmb or the spacebar to use the tongue is also very impressive coding, not only in the intellectual sense, but also creative sense too, because it is something I didn't even think about when doing my own Mod Jam, and it's the first mod jam that I've seen that has these options for the players. The experience was quite nice too, the game is fun to play. However, I wished that there were less hotdogs, or that they were a little bit smaller, and that there were more broccolis, or that they were a little bit bigger. It kinda took away from my own experience playing the game, because I felt like it made it hard, but not in a way that was fun. 

Olivia Ho
(https://oliv-codes.github.io/CART-253/Mod-Jam/frogfrogfrog/) I really like the art that was used for the opening, winning and losing screen. It balances out the game, where not much is going on aesthetically, since it focuses more on the goal of eating flies, rather than the visual. The style is kinda funny, because the frog has a cartoonish and exaggerated vibe. The fullness meter is also really cool. I wish that the game was a little bit more complex, because apart from the red flies, there isn't much obstacles, which makes it easy to win. Also, it only takes one flies to kill the frog, it would've been fun to maybe have the frog slowly die by making it change color, or by having the fullness meter decrease, etc. It resembles the original frog-frog-frog template a lot.
