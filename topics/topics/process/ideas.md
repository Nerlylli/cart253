# Mod Jam ideas
1. Turn the frog into a unicorn
    - Add a horn to the animal

2. Make the background into a palace 

3. Change the colors to something more pastel(the tounge, the background, the flies) 

4. A score
    - The score is in a crown like shape

5. Limited amount of hearts (only 3, they represent the unicorn's lives left)
    - Each live can survive 2 bad flies. 
    - Only decrease to a half-heart. 
    - When all 3 lives/6 chances are lost, the unicorn loses (doesn't die, because unicorns are immortal magic beings)

6. Some flies are bad
    - (IN ASSOCIATION WITH IDEA #7); if eaten, no point is lost, but a life is lost

7. Some candy are thrown from the palace in the background
    - Doesn't increase points
    - Gives half of a heart 
    - Life only increases IF unicorn eats it

8.  Some flies fly through the screen faster than others
    - they are golden
    - they count for more than slower flies
    - they are worth +5 points

9. Unicorn changes color depending on what kind of fly it ate.

10. Sound of unicorn neighing
