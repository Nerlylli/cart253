# Mod Jam ideas
1. Turn the frog into a unicorn
    - Add a horn to the animal

2. Make the background into a palace 

3. Change the colors to something more pastel(the background, the flies) 

4. Replace tongue with horn

5. Before game starts, message pops up
    - "You have to protect the palace from bugs..."

6. Limited amount of lives (only 3, they represent the unicorn's lives left)
    - Represented by crown
        - Bottom right
    - Each live can survive 2 bad flies. 
    - Only decrease to a half a crown 

7. Some flies are bad
    - (IN ASSOCIATION WITH IDEA #6); if eaten, half a crown is lost

8. Some candy are thrown from the palace in the background
    - Gives half of a crown back
    - Life only increases IF unicorn eats it

9.  Some flies fly through the screen faster than others
    - they are golden
    - they are rare
    - they count for more than candies
    - they heal ALL crown lost

10. Unicorn changes color depending on what kind of fly it ate.
    - Normal fly; stays original color (white)
    - Fast flies; turns gold temporarily
    - Candy; turns pink temporarily 

11. Three light are on in the palace
    - Can be seen in some windows
    - When a whole crown is lost, one light turns off
    - (#8) Candies become more rare
    - (#9)All lights turn back on
    - You can hear cheers from the palace

12. Unicorn changes color depending on what kind of fly it ate.

13. Sound of unicorn neighing 
    - Sound nevers stops

14. Instead of eating flies with tongue, unicorn disintegrates them with horn powers. 

15. Sound of laser whenever a fly gets disintegrated by horn powers

16. Colors become more faded every half-crown is lost
    - less pastels
    - more dark

17. Colors become less faded everytime half-crown is gained
    - more pastels
    - lighter
    - everything goes back to normal instantly if candy is eaten

18. When all 3 lives/6 chances are lost, the unicorn loses 
    - doesn't die, because unicorns are immortal magic beings

19. There is no way to win, you can only lose the game

20. If game is lost, screen turns black
    - Message; do you believe in unicorns?
    - Options: YES, NO
        - If person answers YES, they get a full life back and are given a second chance
        - If person answers NO, the whole canvas crashes out and message; Shun the non-believers! appears everywhere
