# ART JAM - VOCALOID VERSION OF ME

[View this project online](https://nerlylli.github.io/cart253/topics/topics/art-jam/)

## Description

This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> The project is an abstract portrait of me and the vibe I wish to curate for myself. It is inspired by vocaloid artists' art aesthetic. That is why the character is wearing headphone and is surrounded by music notes. There is also a unicorn, because I believe in unicorns and I believe that being a unicorn is about energy rather than the actual phyiscal. 

> The project is interactive. By moving the white circles around, the unicorn horn project lights that changes colors. The music notes, although lacking user interactions, move around. 

## Screenshot(s)

This bit should have some images of the program running so that the reader has a sense of what it looks like. For example:
